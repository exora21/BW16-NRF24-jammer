This project generates a constant carrier signal using the nRF24L01 RF module, with
automatic channel hopping across the entire 2.4GHz spectrum (channels 0-125).
It's designed for:
- RF testing and analysis
- Spectrum monitoring
- RF interference testing
- Educational demonstrations of RF principles
- Wireless signal generation
